## Task 3: Use Array Functions and Destructuring

In the code snipped you have some oppertunities to refactor your code.
Try to use the [Destructuring Assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) and also some functional programming with the [Array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).

At the end your code should be much more readable and self explaining.
